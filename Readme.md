[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xDGeForcexD/ah-mixer-remote.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xDGeForcexD/ah-mixer-remote)

With this library you can build your own application to control an Allen & Heath digital mixer.
This library a writen in Typescript to use it with NodeJS.   
    
This library is written for an automation software but you can use also for your ideas.


## Supported Mixer

Following the supported digital mixer are:

* SQ Mixer


This library is designed to use it also for multiply mixer types.   
So if you want you can fork this project and add support for other mixer from Allen & Heath.
Maybe for QU, Avantis and DLive.

To add this lib to your project execute this command:    
`npm install ah-mixer-remote`

to add it to your package.json:    
`npm install --save ah-mixer-remote`


## How to use

I have created an example repository were you can find example applications.
